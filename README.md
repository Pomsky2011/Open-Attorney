# Open Attorney

An open-source SDL Ace Attorney Engine.

## Dependencies

SDL2 (Latest)

## Building

This is the only known method, embarassingly:

Use Visual Studio Code for your OS, with this repo cloned or downloaded.

Install the C/C++ Extensions, and CMake. Then, build the repo.

## What this does

It opens a window. You can change its color through the terminal.

## How to get cases

Right now, you don't.

In the near future, you might be able to make cases set in courtrooms.

In the future, you will be able to make investigations, and import special .cas files made for Open Attorney.

In the far future, you will be able to import the RomFS of a NON-PIRATED 3DS Copy of the Trilogy as a .zip, and everything but "Rise from the Ashes" will work.

In the FAR far future, you will be able to import any decrypted, NON-PIRATED ROM of any game.
