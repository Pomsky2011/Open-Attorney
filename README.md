# Open Attorney

An open-source SDL Ace Attorney Engine.

## Dependencies

SDL2 (Latest)

C++ 11

## Building

This is the only known method, embarassingly:

Use Visual Studio Code for your OS, with this repo cloned or downloaded.

Install the C/C++ Extensions, and CMake. Then, build the repo.

## What this does

So far, it only opens a blank window. Color changing soon :)
